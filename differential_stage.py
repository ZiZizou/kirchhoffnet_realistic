"""DifferentialStage: sparse COO graph + KCL scatter-add + Heun integration.

Per-node dynamics:
    C_eff * dx_j/dt = sum_in I_edge - sum_out I_edge - leak_j * x_j - clip_j(x_j)

Edge currents are computed by a per-edge device library.
Heun integration (predictor-corrector, 2nd order) is used for fixed-step
BPTT. The stage returns both the final state and the full trajectory so
that regularizers can be evaluated along the path.

Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) forward path (deq-core-prototype plan): the stage
exposes ``forward_equilibrium`` which solves ``rhs(x*)=0`` via the
:mod:`deq_solver` adapter and returns implicit gradients. Selected by
passing ``solver='deq'`` to ``forward``.

class DifferentialStage(nn.Module):
    """A single stage of the reduced differential KirchhoffNet.

    Args:
        num_nodes: Number of differential nodes in this stage's internal state.
        src: List of source node ids (length E).
        dst: List of destination node ids (length E).
        cell_lib: Edge device library used to compute edge currents.
        c_eff: Effective node capacitance (default from config).
        x_max: Differential rail limit (default from config).
        clip_current: Soft rail clip current magnitude (default from config).
        clip_softness: Soft rail clip transition width (default from config).
        learnable_clip_sharpness: When ``True``, the soft-rail clip
            denominator ``s`` becomes a per-stage learnable scalar
            (``clip_sharpness_raw``) mapped into
            ``[clip_sharpness_min, clip_sharpness_max]`` via sigmoid and
            logit-initialized so the mapped value equals
            ``clip_sharpness_init`` at startup (epoch-0 forward identical to
            the fixed path when ``clip_sharpness_init == clip_softness``).
            When ``False`` (default) ``s`` is the fixed ``clip_softness``
            float and the forward is bit-identical to the pre-F1 baseline.
        clip_sharpness_init: Initial mapped sharpness for the learnable
            path (default from config ``PHYS['clip_sharpness_init']``).
        clip_sharpness_min: Lower bound of the mapped learnable sharpness
            (default from config ``PHYS['clip_sharpness_min']``).
        clip_sharpness_max: Upper bound of the mapped learnable sharpness
            (default from config ``PHYS['clip_sharpness_max']``).
        write_idx: Indices of hidden nodes that receive persistent bounded
            drive current. When provided, a drive source is created with
            learnable per-node conductance ``raw_drive_g``. ``None`` disables
            drive for this stage.
        drive_isat: Saturation current for the bounded drive source. When
            ``None``, uses ``config.DRIVE["drive_isat"]``.
        leak_mode: ``"programmable"`` (default) creates a learnable per-node
            ``raw_leak`` parameter. ``"non-programmable"`` uses a fixed scalar
            ``leak_constant`` (see ``leak_constant``) for all nodes, saving
            parameters and eliminating leak gradients.
        leak_constant: Fixed leak value used when ``leak_mode="non-programmable"``.
            When ``None``, defaults to ``config.INIT["leak_constant"]``
            (0.0486, matching ``softplus(raw_leak_init)``). Ignored when
            ``leak_mode="programmable"``.
        freeze_read: When ``True``, edge currents (cell_lib output, edge gate,
            budget gate, and KCL scatter-add) are computed **once** at the
            start of the stage from the initial state ``x0`` and held constant
            throughout all Heun / DEQ sub-iterations. Leak, clip, and drive
            current still read the evolving ``x`` at each step. Default
            ``False`` (standard behavior: read and write at the same time).
            When ``core_refresh_interval > 0`` the core current is
            recomputed every ``k`` Heun steps regardless of ``freeze_read``;
            this lets a single ``freeze_read=False`` model emulate the
            legacy ``freeze_read=True`` baseline (``k >= num_steps``) up
            to fully dynamic (``k == 1``) by varying only the interval.
        freeze_boundary: When ``True``, boundary fan-out edge currents (the
            tanh cell contribution with edge gate + VCA gate folded in) are
            computed **once** from ``(u, x0)`` and held constant across all
            Heun / DEQ sub-iterations, while the family's resistive shunt
            (when present) remains dynamic per-step. Mirrors the
            ``freeze_read`` semantics for the boundary edge family.
            Independent of ``freeze_read`` (can be combined). No-op when the
            stage has no boundary edges. Default ``False``.
        freeze_temporal_read: When ``True``, temporal-readout edge currents
            (the tanh cell contribution with edge gate + VCA gate folded
            in) are computed once from ``x0`` and held constant across all
            Heun / DEQ iterations. The family's resistive shunt (when
            present) stays dynamic per-step, mirroring the
            ``freeze_read`` behavior for the core graph. Independent of
            ``freeze_read`` and ``freeze_boundary`` (can be combined). No-op
            when the stage has no temporal-readout edges.
            In ``readout_mode="shared_sense"`` the same flag dispatches
            ``_compute_frozen_sense`` (returning ``[B, n_sense]`` per-sense
            currents) and the shared branch's frozen path uses those as the
            tanh contribution while the resistive shunt stays dynamic.
            Default ``False``.
        boundary_src: List of input-terminal indices for sparse OTA edges
            from fixed-voltage boundary terminals into the dynamic fabric.
            Length must equal ``len(boundary_dst)``. ``None`` (default)
            disables boundary edges for this stage.
        boundary_dst: List of target dynamic-node indices for the boundary
            OTA edges (same length as ``boundary_src``). Indices are in
            the compact 0..num_nodes-1 coordinate space, matching
            ``write_idx``.
        boundary_cell_lib: Cell library instance used to compute boundary
            edge currents ``I_OTA(u_i, x_j)``. Must match the cell type
            of the core ``cell_lib`` and be sized for ``len(boundary_src)``
            edges. Must be provided when boundary edges are configured.
        enable_ref_edges: When ``True``, every node gets one OTA edge to a
            global per-stage learnable reference voltage ``Vref`` (scalar,
            constrained to ``[0, x_max]`` via ``sigmoid(raw_vref) * x_max``).
            Vref is held constant during the ODE integration of a single
            stage (no current sourced/sinked into Vref; it's an ideal voltage
            source). The reference edge injects ``I_OTA(Vref, x_j)`` into
            node ``j`` only. Implemented via a separate cell library
            (``ref_cell_lib``) sized to ``num_nodes`` so each node has its
            own programmable OTA parameters. Default ``False``.
        ref_cell_lib: Cell library instance used to compute reference edge
            currents ``I_OTA(Vref, x_j)``. Must match the cell type of
            the core ``cell_lib`` and be sized for ``num_nodes`` edges. Required
            when ``enable_ref_edges=True``.
        output_ode_src: List of source node indices (compact 0..num_nodes-1
            coordinate space) for the temporal-readout OTA edges. These edges
            inject current from a hidden (or projection) node into an output
            ODE accumulator node. The source is read-only (its voltage drives
            the OTA current but no current is drained from the source); the
            output ODE node is the writable destination. Length must equal
            ``len(output_ode_dst)`` when provided. ``None`` (default)
            disables temporal-readout edges for this stage.
        output_ode_dst: List of destination node indices (compact 0..num_nodes-1
            coordinate space, same length as ``output_ode_src``) for the
            temporal-readout OTA edges. Indices typically lie in the
            output-ode accumulator region (e.g., ``[core_count, num_nodes)``),
            but any valid node index is permitted so a hidden→hidden
            temporal-readout edge is also expressible.
        output_ode_cell_lib: Cell library instance used to compute temporal
            readout edge currents ``I_OTA(x_src, x_dst)``. Must match the
            cell type of the core ``cell_lib`` and be sized for
            ``len(output_ode_src)`` edges. Required when
            ``output_ode_src``/``output_ode_dst`` are provided.
        readout_mode: ``"ota_mesh"`` (default) keeps today's h*d_out
            temporal-readout OTA mesh (each edge has its own cell, gate, and
            VCA tap). ``"shared_sense"`` replaces the mesh with one sense
            OTA per hidden node (optionally two at different operating
            points, see ``readout_senses_per_node``) plus a plain dense
            crossbar ``readout_crossbar_W`` that mixes the sense currents
            into the output-ODE accumulator tail. Exclusive with
            ``output_ode_src``/``output_ode_dst`` (pass ``None`` for those in
            shared mode).
        readout_senses_per_node: ``1`` or ``2``; only meaningful when
            ``readout_mode="shared_sense"``. ``2`` builds two sense OTAs per
            hidden node (the second copy is init-jittered by the topology
            builder so the operating points differ).
        readout_sense_src: For ``shared_sense`` only: list of source node
            indices (compact ``0..num_nodes-1``), one entry per sense cell
            (``s*h`` entries, hidden node ``h`` repeated ``s`` times).
        readout_sense_cell_lib: For ``shared_sense`` only: per-stage-owned
            cell library sized ``len(readout_sense_src)``, used to compute
            sense currents ``I_OTA(x_src_j, Vref)`` against the stage's
            private learnable ``Vref`` rail.
        readout_crossbar_shape: For ``shared_sense`` only: ``(d_out,
            n_sense)`` where ``d_out`` is the number of output-ODE
            accumulator nodes at the state tail and ``n_sense ==
            len(readout_sense_src)``. The caller passes the shape explicitly
            because the stage does not know ``d_out`` directly.

        Gate application:
        - Edge gate: i_edge *= sigmoid(z_logits) — multiplies the edge current
          after cell-library evaluation. When z_e -> 0 the edge contributes
          zero current.

        When ``i_edge_const`` is provided (the ``freeze_read=True`` path), the
        cell_lib evaluation, edge gate, budget gate, and KCL scatter-add are
        skipped — the provided ``[batch, num_nodes]`` tensor is used directly
        as the KCL contribution. Leak, clip, and drive current are still
        computed from the current ``x``.

        Boundary-terminal OTA edges (boundary-fan-out plan):
        - When ``u`` is provided and ``self._has_boundary``, the boundary
          edges inject ``I_OTA(u[:, boundary_src], x[:, boundary_dst])``
          into the destination nodes only (no source drain — terminals
          are fixed voltages). They are NOT frozen by ``freeze_read``:
          the destination voltage evolves, so the OTA current is
          recomputed every step. When ``i_boundary_const`` is provided
          (the ``freeze_boundary=True`` path) the tanh cell contribution
          + edge gate + VCA gate are precomputed once from ``(u, x0)``
          and the per-step block only recomputes the family's resistive
          shunt (when present).

        Reference edges (unary nonlinearities via OTA-to-Vref plan):
        - When ``self._has_ref``, every node gets one OTA edge to a
          global per-stage learnable ``Vref = sigmoid(raw_vref) * x_max``.
          The reference current ``I_OTA(Vref, x_j)`` is injected into
          node ``j`` only (no source drain — Vref is an ideal voltage
          source). Like boundary edges, reference currents are NOT frozen
          by ``freeze_read`` (the destination voltage ``x_j`` evolves).

        Temporal-readout OTA edges (temporal-readout plan):
        - When ``self._has_output_ode``, ``I_OTA(x[output_ode_src[e]],
          x[output_ode_dst[e]])`` is injected into the destination (output
          ODE accumulator) only. The source (hidden/projection) is a
          read-only voltage — no current is drained from it. Like boundary
          and reference edges, the temporal-readout current is NOT frozen
          by ``freeze_read`` (the destination voltage evolves). When
          ``i_readout_const`` is provided (the ``freeze_temporal_read=True``
          path) the tanh cell contribution + edge gate + VCA gate are
          precomputed once from ``x0`` and the per-step block only
          recomputes the family's resistive shunt (when present).

        Shared-sense + crossbar readout (shared-sense-crossbar plan):
        - When ``self._has_shared_readout`` (mutually exclusive with the
          legacy mesh), one sense OTA per hidden node drives against a
          private learnable ``Vref`` rail; the per-sense currents are mixed
          by a plain dense crossbar ``readout_crossbar_W`` and injected into
          the last ``d_out`` output-ODE accumulator nodes only (no source
          drain). The family is NOT frozen by ``freeze_read`` (the sense
          sources evolve). When ``i_readout_const`` is provided
          (``freeze_temporal_read=True``) its shape is ``[B, n_sense]`` in
          shared mode (mode-dependent: ``[B, num_nodes]`` in the legacy mesh
          path) and the per-step block only recomputes the family's
          resistive shunt (when present).
