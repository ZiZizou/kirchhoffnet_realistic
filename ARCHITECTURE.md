## 1. High-Level Overview

### What this is

A PyTorch implementation of an **analog-inspired neural ODE** based on KirchhoffNet. Each logical node is a **differential pair** of physical voltages (v⁺, v⁻), and the computation happens via **sparse transconductor edges** that mediate current flow between nodes. The network evolves in continuous time, integrated with a fixed-step Heun solver. Training is direct backpropagation-through-time (BPTT).

### Relationship to the original KirchhoffNet paper

The original paper described a graph neural ODE dressed in circuit language. This reimplementation fixes the paper's biggest omissions:

| Original paper | This implementation |
|---|---|
| Branch law = `ReLU(θ₁·Δv + θ₂)` (impossible passive device) | Branch law = library of realizable transconductor surrogates (legacy/v15/v2 libraries, relu/tanh simple devices) |
| Implicitly powered edges (no energy source) | Explicit rail-powered differential transconductor cells + node leak + rail clamps |
| Implied fully connected hardware | Sparse topologies only (line/ring/cluster/grid/empty) |
| Adaptive ODE solver + adjoint | Fixed-step Heun + direct BPTT |
| Single-ended 0-to-VDD encoding | Differential signaling: xⱼ = vⱼ⁺ − vⱼ⁻ |
| No variation/robustness story | SimContext injects PVT + per-edge mismatch at training time |
| Arbitrary topology rewiring between "layers" | Fixed physical stages with simple truncation/padding transfer |
| Per-edge raw device geometry training | Soft library selection over pre-characterized cell families |

### What this is NOT

- **Not a SPICE-accurate circuit simulator.** The edge currents use idealized tanh surrogates with compliance gating, not full transistor models.
- **Not a tapeout-ready netlist.** It omits common-mode dynamics, non-diagonal capacitance, sample-and-hold circuitry, and post-layout parasitics.
- **Not the final signoff model.** It is a training scaffold for architecture search and task feasibility experiments.

## 2. Core Design Decisions

### 2.1 Differential signaling

Each logical node `j` is represented by two voltages:

```
xⱼ = vⱼ⁺ − vⱼ⁻        (differential signal — the useful state)
cⱼ = (vⱼ⁺ + vⱼ⁻) / 2   (common-mode — assumed held by feedback)
```

The reduced model assumes strong common-mode feedback so we only simulate `xⱼ`. This gives natural signed representation without awkward "negative in 0-to-VDD" hacks.

**Units (R7).** The conductance, current, and capacitance values in `config.py` are NORMALIZED to plausible analog ranges, not calibrated to SI. `x_max` was raised to 3.0 to give the solver more dynamic range and avoid saturation. `C_eff` is a pure scaling. No pretense is made that `g/C` is a real analog time constant. `V_CM` has been removed from `PHYS` since it is not simulated. `t_span=5.0` and `num_steps=50` are the defaults.

### 2.2 Sparse topologies only

No fully connected layers. Supported graph primitives:
- `line_graph` — 1D chain with neighborhood radius
- `ring_graph` — 1D periodic chain
- `grid_graph` — 2D local grid with kernel neighborhood
- `cluster_graph` — Erdős-Rényi random sparse graph
- `empty_graph` — no edges (for ablation or projection-only stages)

All primitives support `bidirectional=True` which emits two directed edges per undirected pair (i→j and j→i), giving asymmetric cell types (P/rectifier) true bidirectional capability. Edge count is exactly 2× the single-direction count.

`repeat_edges(topo, n)` duplicates `EDGE_TYPE_HIDDEN` edges n times (parallel branches). Each repeated edge gets independent logits/gate/multiplier in `DifferentialStage`. Non-hidden edges (input, proj, output) are NOT repeated.

### 2.3 Cell library instead of raw device parameters

Edges don't learn raw W/L or bias voltages. They soft-select from one of several pre-characterized cell families.

The codebase supports 4 cell formula types dispatched via `cell_type_code`:

| Formula | Code | I(u) expression |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| `standard` | 0 | `I_sat · tanh((gm·u + bias) / I_sat) + g_leak · u` |
| `pos_rect` | 1 | `I_sat · tanh(gm · softplus((u−θ)/β) / I_sat)` |
| `neg_rect` | 2 | `-I_sat · tanh(gm · softplus((−u−θ)/β) / I_sat)` |
| `dead_zone` | 3 | `pos_rect(u) − neg_rect(u)` |

The preactivation `u` is computed as `x_src − ρ · x_dst` (legacy/v15 libraries) or `src_gain · x_src − dst_gain · x_dst` (v2 library with per-cell mix coefficients).

Three named cell libraries are defined, plus two simple device modes:

**Legacy library** (4 cells): L (weak linear, gm=0.2), S (saturating, gm=1.0), P (smooth rectifier, gm=1.0, β=0.1), Z (disabled). Backward-compatible globals `CELL_LIBRARY`, `CELL_ORDER`, `NUM_CELLS`, `Z_INDEX` reflect this library.

**v1.5 library** (6 cells): O_weak (gm=0.3, isat=5.0), O_hard (gm=3.0, isat=0.3), P0 (pos_rect, gm=1.0, β=0.1), N0 (neg_rect, mirror of P0), D1 (dead_zone, θ=0.5, β=0.1), Z.

**v2 library** (10 cells, mix-code/bias-code bounded): Built from factorized MIX/BIAS/THRESH codes. Mix codes (M11/M10/M01) set per-cell `src_gain/dst_gain` replacing rho. Bias codes (Bsoft/Bmid/Bhard) set discrete (gm, isat) pairs. Threshold codes (T0/T1) set preactivation offsets. Cells: O_w11, O_h11, O_h10, O_h01, P0, P1, N0, N1, D1, Z. All v2 cells have gleak=0. P/N beta=0.08, D beta=0.10.

**Simple device libraries** (`relu`/`tanh`): Each edge holds 3 learnable parameters (p0, p1, p2) and computes `I = ReLU(p0·Vsrc + p1·Vdest + p2)` or `I = tanh(...)`. No cell selection, no multiplicity, no Z cell.

The `CELL_LIBRARIES` dict maps library name to config. `cells_to_tensor_dict(library_name)` stacks the named library into tensors. `make_cell_library(library_name)` returns an `IdealizedCellLibrary` for bounded macro libraries or a `SimpleEdgeLibrary` for simple devices.

Per-edge learnable parameters:
- **logits** `[E, Q]` — soft library selection (log-probabilities). Not used by `SimpleEdgeLibrary`.
- **raw_mult** `[E]` — edge multiplicity `m = softplus(raw_mult)` (can approach 0). Not used by `SimpleEdgeLibrary`.
- **raw_leak** `[N]` — per-node weak stabilization leak `g = softplus(raw_leak)`

**Cell mode** (`cell_mode`): `'soft'` (default) uses a softmax mixture of all cells per edge. `'ste'` (straight-through estimator) uses one-hot argmax in the forward pass with soft gradients in the backward pass — used for hard cell commitment during four-phase schedule B/C phases.

**Honest I/O split (R1).** The InputMapper writes ONLY to the hidden-node portion of the differential state vector. Projection nodes are zero-initialized and remain so until the ODE moves them. The OutputMapper reads ONLY from the projection-node portion; if no projection nodes exist (legacy/ablation), it falls back to hidden positions with a warning. This forces the ODE core to do the work.

### 2.4 Fixed-step Heun integration (not adjoint)

The ODE `C · dx/dt = Σ I_in − Σ I_out − leak · x − clip(x)` is integrated with Heun's method (predictor-corrector, 2nd order):

```
k1 = rhs(x)
x_pred = x + dt · k1
k2 = rhs(x_pred)
x_next = x + (dt/2) · (k1 + k2)
```

Gradients flow directly through the unrolled steps (BPTT). No continuous adjoint. This is more reliable for stiff, physically constrained systems.

### 2.5 Write/Evolve/Read pipeline

The network operates in three phases:
1. **Write:** `InputMapper` (dense), `SparseInputMapper` (one-to-one), or `FanOutInputMapper` (multi-target) maps raw input `u` to bounded initial differential state `x_hidden(0)`. Hidden nodes NOT in `write_idx` are zero-initialized. Projection portion `x_proj(0) = 0`.
2. **Evolve:** Multi-stage ODE core integrates for fixed time horizons. The core evolves hidden + projection nodes together. Persistent drive current may be injected per-stage when enabled.
3. **Read:** `OutputMapper` linearly projects either the full state slice (sparse `read_idx`) or the projection portion (dense) to output `ŷ`.

**Sparse I/O mapping (sparse-io-mapping spec).** Each preset specifies `write_idx` and `read_idx` lists, and the default write/read modes are:
- `--write-mode one_to_one` (default): each input feature `u_i` writes to exactly one hidden node `h_{write_idx[i]}` via `SparseInputMapper`. Hidden nodes not in `write_idx` are zero-initialized at t=0. Parameter count: `2 * in_dim` (vs `in_dim * hid_count + hid_count` for dense `InputMapper`).
- **Fan-out write** (not a CLI `--write-mode` choice; set per-preset via `write_fan_out`): each input feature writes to K>1 hidden nodes via `FanOutInputMapper` with per-target (gain, bias) pairs.
- `--read-mode sparse` (default): `OutputMapper` gathers only from `read_idx` full-state indices (a learnable linear of size `len(read_idx) -> out_dim`).
- `--write-mode dense` / `--read-mode dense`: original `InputMapper` / `OutputMapper` behavior for baseline comparison.

Preset defaults:
- `sinx`: `write_mode=one_to_one`, `write_idx=[0]`, `read_mode=sparse`, `read_idx=[7]` (out of 8 hidden + 2 proj = 10)
- `housing`: `write_mode=one_to_one`, `write_idx=[0..7]`, `read_mode=sparse`, `read_idx=[15]` (out of 16 hidden + 4 proj = 20)
- `smooth2d_grid`: `write_mode=fan_out`, `write_fan_out` = auto-computed left/right column indices (depends on grid_size), `read_mode=sparse`, `read_idx` = center column + proj nodes
- `housing_grid`: `write_mode=dense` (all-to-all, 8 housing features have no spatial structure), `read_idx` = center column + proj nodes

CLI flags: `--write-mode {one_to_one,dense}`, `--read-mode {sparse,dense}`, `--write-idx "0,2,4"`, `--read-idx "7"`. The index overrides take precedence over preset values. Fan-out write is only available through the `write_fan_out` preset config (not as a CLI `--write-mode` choice).

### 2.6 Staged regularizer warm-up (RR-A)

By default, the auxiliary regularizers (sparsity, edge_gate, power) are **ramped in** over the first 150 epochs so the network can learn the task first without penalty fighting (node_gate and capacitance regularizers are deprecated — always 0.0):
- **Epochs 0–99 (`W=100`)**: all are multiplied by 0.0 (free phase).
- **Epochs 100–149 (`W+A=150`)**: linear anneal from 0.0 → 1.0.
- **Epochs 150+**: full penalty value.

The schedule is controlled by `reg_schedule(epoch)` in `train.py` and configurable via `OPTIM["reg_warmup_epochs"]` and `OPTIM["reg_anneal_epochs"]` in `config.py`. **Note (fix-z-death)**: `rail` is intentionally NOT in `_REG_KEYS`; it is a safety voltage clamp on differential node states and is applied at full strength at every epoch. The rail loss uses a **ReLU² quadratic barrier** (`F.relu(|x| - x_max).pow(2).mean()`) which has zero loss and zero gradient inside `[-x_max, x_max]`. The entropy bonus retains its own τ-dependent scaling.

### 2.7 Per-component complexity regularizers (complexity-pruning-v2)

The old single `complexity` key is **decomposed into 4 physically motivated terms** for finer-grained control over the pruning process:

| Regularizer | What it penalizes | Default weight |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `edge_gate` | `Σ σ(z_e)` — open edge count | 5e-4 |
| `node_gate` | `Σ σ(u_j)` — open node count **(deprecated, always 0.0)** | 0.0 |
| `power` | `Σ_e σ(z_e) · m_e · Σ_q p(L|e,q) · gm_q` — static power proxy | 1e-4 |
| `capacitance` | `Σ_j σ(u_j)` — node capacitance area proxy **(deprecated, always 0.0)** | 0.0 |
| `sparsity` | `Σ w[:, :z_idx]` — active non-Z cell mass | 1e-3 |
| `rail` (ReLU²) | `mean(ReLU²(|x| - x_max))` over trajectory | 0.1 |
| `entropy` | `−Σ w·log(w)` of logits/tau | 1e-4·τ |

In addition, **learnable gate parameters** are added to every `DifferentialStage`:
- `z_logits [E]` — edge open-logit (init 0.0 → `σ(0) ≈ 0.50`). Each `i_edge` is multiplied by `σ(z_logits[e])` in `rhs()`, so a closed edge contributes zero current.
- `u_logits [N]` — node open-logit **(deprecated, bypassed in `rhs()`)**. No longer applied in forward pass — node mask is always 1.0. Parameter kept for checkpoint compatibility only.

The gate init is 0.0 to place gates at the **maximum-gradient** point of the sigmoid (`dσ/dz = 0.25` at `z=0`).

Helper methods on `DifferentialStage`:
- `edge_gates()` — returns `σ(z_logits)`
- `node_gates()` — returns all-ones tensor (deprecated, always identity)
- `active_edge_mask(threshold=0.01)` — edge gates above threshold
- `active_node_mask(threshold=0.01)` — all-True (deprecated)
- `parameter_breakdown()` — returns dict with gate values

The gate regularizers (edge_gate, power) go through the same staged warm-up as sparsity. node_gate and capacitance are deprecated (hard-coded to 0.0).

### 2.8 Complexity pruning pipeline

After training with gate parameters, the network can be structurally pruned to remove low-value edges.

**Joint Z+gate criterion.** An edge is kept if its effective activity score exceeds a threshold:

```
eff_score(e) = (1 - P(Z|e)) · σ(z_e) > edge_threshold
```

This folds both the Z-cell probability (gm_Z ≈ 0 ⇒ no current) and the edge gate into a single criterion. The default threshold is 0.1.

**Connectivity backstop.** After gate-based pruning, a BFS from `write_idx` verifies that all `read_idx` are reachable. Dead islands (nodes not in any I/O-connected component) are purged. If fewer than `min_read_nodes` survive, pruning raises `ValueError`.

**Protected nodes.** Write targets (input-side guard) are forced to survive pruning regardless of gate value. Driven nodes (persistent drive) are also protected. Read nodes are NOT protected (elastic readout is allowed).

**Edge-only mode (default).** Node gates are deprecated and bypassed in `rhs()`. Pruning is exclusively connectivity-based — `prune_nodes_by_gate` defaults to `False`. Nodes are only removed via the connectivity backstop (dead island purge).

**I/O mapper transfer.** After pruning, the InputMapper and OutputMapper are rebuilt with weights transferred from the pre-prune network. `SparseInputMapper` weights are copied directly (indexed by input). `FanOutInputMapper` targets are remapped through the stage node remap. `InputMapper`/`RobustInputMapper` rows are selectively copied for surviving nodes.

**SimpleEdgeLibrary handling.** Stages using `SimpleEdgeLibrary` have no Z cell — the effective score is just `σ(z_logits)`.

Key functions in `topology.py`:
- `prune_stage(stage, edge_threshold, ...)` — returns `(new_stage, node_remap)`. Handles persistent drive, SimpleEdgeLibrary.
- `prune_network(core, ...)` — applies `prune_stage` to every stage, reinitializes `StageTransfer` modules, protects driven nodes, returns `(new_core, stage_remaps)`

The `train_script.py` CLI exposes:
- `--prune` — enable pruning after training
- `--retrain` / `--no-retrain` — retrain pruned network (default: retrain)
- `--prune-edge-threshold` — override edge gate threshold
- `--prune-node-threshold` — override node gate threshold
- `--prune-nodes-by-gate` / `--no-prune-nodes-by-gate` — deprecated no-op
- `--retrain-epochs` — retraining epochs
- `--fresh-init` — skip warm-start, reinitialize pruned network from scratch

### 2.9 Three-phase training schedule (three-phase-schedule plan)

A generic phased training pipeline that any preset can opt into via `preset["schedule"] = "three_phase"`. Splits the total epoch budget into three phases with independently configured tau annealing and structural regularizer magnitudes:

| Phase | Epochs | Tau | Regularizers | Action |
|-------|--------|-----|-------------|--------|
| **A** (fit) | 0–30% | Fixed 0.8 | All zero — free fit | Network learns task without structure pressure |
| **B** (compress) | 30–70% | 0.8→0.5 anneal | Gate penalties ramped in | Gate logits pushed toward 0 (closed) or stay open; node_gate deprecated (0.0) |
| **C** (retrain) | 70–100% | 0.5→0.1 anneal | Only sparsity (1e-5) + rail | Auto-prune at B→C boundary, retrain compact network |

**Phase A (fit, epochs 0–30%).** All structural regularizers are zeroed. Tau stays at 0.8 (no hardening pressure). The network learns the task freely. Rail is always active as a safety net.

**Phase B (compress, epochs 30–70%).** Tau anneals from 0.8→0.5 (gentle specialization). Structural regularizers are ramped from 0 to full over the first 50% of Phase B: sparsity=5e-5, edge_gate=1e-5, power=1e-5. node_gate and capacitance are 0.0 (deprecated).

**Phase C (retrain, epochs 70–100%).** At the B→C boundary, automatic pruning removes edges below the schedule's thresholds (edge_threshold=0.05, prune_nodes_by_gate=False — edge-only pruning). The compact network is retrained from warm-start with aggressive tau annealing (0.5→0.1) and only sparsity (1e-5) + rail (unchanged). Gate penalties are off (irrelevant post-prune).

**Solidification diagnostics.** During Phases A and B, per-epoch metrics are logged to `solidification.tsv`:
- `mean_max_cell_prob`: mean over all edges of max(softmax(logits/τ)).
- `mean_pZ`: probability mass on the Z cell.
- `mean_sigma_z/u`: average edge/node gate openness.
- `frac_sigma_z_below_0.1/0.05/0.01`: fraction of edges eligible for pruning.

**Argmax validation.** At each validation epoch, the network is evaluated with τ→0.001 (effectively argmax cell selection) and the task loss is compared against the soft-τ baseline. A small gap means cell selection is solidified.

The `--schedule {legacy,three_phase,four_phase}` CLI flag selects the mode. `smooth2d_grid` defaults to `three_phase` via its preset config.

### 2.10 Per-preset lambda overrides (RR-D)

Each preset may optionally contain a `"lambdas"` dict that is merged on top of the global `LAMBDAS`. This allows per-task tuning of a single regularizer weight without redefining the entire dictionary.

Active overrides:
- **sinx**: `{"rail": 1.0}`.
- **smooth2d_grid**: `{"sparsity": 1e-5, "edge_gate": 5e-6, "node_gate": 0.0, "power": 1e-5, "capacitance": 0.0, "rail": 0.1}`.
- **housing_grid**: same as smooth2d_grid (identical lambda override).
- **housing**: no override.

### 2.11 Deprecated `temp_c` sampling (RR-C)

The `temp_c` field of `SimContext` is preserved for API compatibility but **no longer used** by the analog model. `sample_random_context` always returns `VARIATION["temp_c_default"]` (27.0°C) and ignores the `temp_choices` argument. External callers that explicitly pass a non-default `temp_c` value receive a `DeprecationWarning`. The `legacy_temp=True` flag exists temporarily for code migration and also emits a warning.

### 2.12 Variation-aware training (R6.3)

By DEFAULT, training uses a `SimContext()` with no mismatch and no temperature drift, so the optimization sees a clean deterministic forward. To evaluate robustness, pass `--variation` to `train_script.py`, which then samples a fresh `SimContext` per training iteration:
- `temp_c` — junction temperature (deprecated, always defaults to 27°C)
- `global_gain_shift` — log-normal global gm drift (σ = 5%)
- `edge_mismatch` — per-edge per-cell log-normal mismatch (σ = 5%)

Mismatch is held fixed over the full transient but resampled each iteration. At validation time, `edge_mismatch=None` (nominal).

### 2.13 Training infrastructure

**AMP (mixed precision).** Enabled by default when CUDA is available (`--amp` / `--no-amp`). Uses `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` with autocast on forward+loss. The loss is split into task+rail (data-dependent) and structural (parameter-only) components so DataParallel averages only the data-dependent part. `--amp-dtype {float16,bfloat16}` selects the autocast dtype.

**torch.compile.** Enabled by default when CUDA is available (`--compile` / `--no-compile`). Uses `torch.compile` on `cell_library.forward` and `stage.rhs` for kernel fusion (~1.3–2× throughput on T4 Tensor Cores). Disabled when DataParallel is active or when compile setup fails.

**DataParallel.** Automatically enabled when ≥2 GPUs are detected (`--parallel` / `--no-parallel`). The regularizer computation is monkey-patched to unwrap DataParallel before accessing per-stage parameters.

**Mapper LR control (mapper LR scale).** `--mapper-lr-scale` (float, default 1.0) creates a separate AdamW param group for I/O mappers at reduced LR in `make_optimizer()`. When `<1.0`, mappers learn more slowly — useful when mapper gradient norms dominate core by ~300×. `--freeze-mappers` freezes I/O mapper parameters at the B1 start and unfreezes at the midpoint (four_phase only). Retrain has separate `--retrain-mapper-lr-scale` flag.

**Per-stage LR scaling (stage-lr-scaling).** Multi-stage networks suffer from vanishing gradients in early stages. `make_optimizer()` can create separate param groups with geometrically increasing LRs: `stage i LR = base_lr × scale^(S−1−i)`. Controlled via `--stage-lr-scale` (default 1.0, disabled). Retrain has a separate `--retrain-stage-lr-scale` (default 1.0) to avoid over-aggressive warm-start updates.

**Gradient logging.** `--grad-log` enables periodic per-parameter-group L2 gradient norms written to `grad_norms.txt`. Each row shows per-stage (logits, raw_mult, raw_leak, z_logits, u_logits, device_param) plus mapper and transfer norms.

**Batch-size-aware LR auto-scaling.** The learning rate is computed as `lr = BASE_LR × (batch_size / BASE_BATCH_SIZE)` (Goyal et al., 2017) where `BASE_LR=3e-4` and `BASE_BATCH_SIZE=1024`. At `batch_size=1024`, this gives `lr=3e-4`.

**entropy bonus.** When `LAMBDAS["entropy"] > 0`, an entropy bonus `−Σ w·log(w)` of the softmax distribution over cell types (scaled by τ) is subtracted from the structural loss, encouraging exploration of cell mixtures.

### 2.14 Four-phase training schedule (four-phase-redesign plan)

A four-phase extension of the three-phase schedule that splits Phase B into B1 (cell commitment, no pruning) and B2 (edge pruning, readiness-gated). Adds teacher distillation and straight-through estimator (STE) cell mode for cleaner hardening.

**Availability and activation.** Any preset can opt into the four-phase schedule via `--schedule four_phase` on the CLI. No preset defaults to four_phase — it is always an explicit override. The CTLE distillation script (`train_ctle.py`) always uses four_phase.

**Config entry (`SCHEDULE_FOUR_PHASE` in `config.py`).** Phase fractions default to frac_a=0.3, frac_b1=0.2, frac_b2=0.2, frac_c=0.3 (must sum to 1.0). Tau targets: tau_a=0.6 (fixed), tau_b1_init=0.6→tau_b1_final=0.5, tau_b2_init=0.5→tau_b2_final=0.4, tau_c_init=0.4→tau_c_final=0.1. Tau is continuous at all phase boundaries. Teacher KD weight: lambda_kd=1.0. Warmup within B1/B2: 25% of each phase's epoch window.

| Phase | Epochs | Tau | Regularizers | Cell Mode | Action |
|-------|--------|-----|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **A** (fit) | 0–30% | Fixed 0.6 | All zero | Soft | Learn task freely |
| **B1** (cell commit) | 30–50% | 0.6→0.5 | sparsity=5e-5, power=1e-4 | STE | Commit cells, no pruning |
| **B2** (edge prune) | 50–70% | 0.5→0.4 | sparsity=5e-5, edge_gate=1e-5, power=1e-5 | STE | Prune edges readiness-gated |
| **C** (retrain) | 70–100% | 0.4→0.1 | sparsity=1e-5 only | STE | Retrain compact model |

---

**Phase A (fit, epochs 0–30%).** Identical to three-phase Phase A: all structural regularizers zeroed, tau=0.6, standard soft cell mixture. The network learns the task freely with no structure pressure. Rail is always active as a safety net.

**Teacher cloning at A→B1 boundary.** At the first epoch of Phase B1, a deep copy of the best Phase A checkpoint (lowest soft validation loss) is frozen as the teacher network. The teacher is kept in eval mode with `requires_grad_(False)` and stays on the device for the remainder of B1+B2. The teacher uses soft cell mode with tau=1.0 — providing a smooth, well-behaved regression target — while the student transitions to STE mode. If training is early-stopped during Phase A (before teacher cloning fires), the four-phase schedule skips pruning and retrain entirely, falling back to a standard save of the best Phase A model.

---

**Phase B1 (cell commitment, epochs 30–50%).** Tau anneals from 0.6→0.5. Only the sparsity regularizer (5e-5) and power (1e-4) are active — no edge_gate/node_gate/capacitance. Cell mode switches to **STE** (straight-through estimator). Teacher distillation (`lambda_kd * MSE(y_student, y_teacher)`) is active throughout B1.

---

**Phase B2 (edge pruning, epochs 50–70%).** Tau continues from 0.5→0.4. The edge_gate regularizer (1e-5) is added to sparsity and power. This is the first time gates receive gradient pressure. STE cell mode and teacher distillation continue from B1.

**Readiness-gated prune.** Pruning is NOT automatic at the B2→C boundary. Instead, on every validation epoch during B2, a readiness check evaluates four AND-logic conditions over a trailing window (default 10 epochs):

1. **Ratio**: `mean(val_argmax / val_soft) < 1.2` over the window.
2. **Cell probability**: `mean_max_cell_prob > 0.85`.
3. **Gate stability**: `std(frac_sigma_z_below_0.1) < 0.02` over the window.
4. **Improvement**: `|val_argmax improvement rate| < 1e-4`.

All four conditions must be met for the readiness check to return True. On readiness trigger, B2 ends immediately and Phase C begins at the current epoch with the freshly pruned network.

**Checkpoint selection during B1/B2.** In B1 and B2, the best model is tracked by `val_argmax` (hard-cell validation loss) rather than soft validation loss.

---

**Phase C (retrain, epochs 70–100%).** At the B2→C boundary (whether readiness-triggered or fallback), auto-pruning removes edges below `prune_edge_threshold=0.05`. Pruning is edge-only (`prune_nodes_by_gate=False`). The compact network is retrained from warm-start with tau annealing 0.4→0.1, only sparsity (1e-5) + rail, STE cell mode continues. Teacher distillation is OFF in Phase C.

---

**Teacher distillation details.** The KD loss is `lambda_kd * MSE(y_student, y_teacher)` where `lambda_kd = 1.0`. The teacher forward pass runs under `torch.no_grad()` with `soft` cell mode and `tau=1.0`. The KD loss is a data-side term (DataParallel-averaged) alongside task loss and rail. KD is active only during B1 and B2.

---

**Cell mode auto-resolution.** `--cell-mode {soft, ste, auto}`. With `--cell-mode auto` (default), the schedule resolves per-epoch: Phase A → `soft`, Phases B1/B2/C → `ste`.

---

**Diagnostic ablation sets.** `--ablation-set`:
- `reg-only`: tau=1.0 throughout B, gate regularizers left at default, pruning disabled.
- `tau-only`: structural regularizers zeroed in B, tau anneals normally, pruning disabled.
- `edge-only`: matches the four-phase defaults (edge-only pruning, edge_threshold=0.05, no node-gate pruning).

---

**Key differences from three-phase:**
| Dimension | Three-phase | Four-phase |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Phases | A (fit) → B (compress) → C (retrain) | A (fit) → B1 (commit) → B2 (prune) → C (retrain) |
| Tau | 0.8 → 0.5 → 0.1 | 0.6 → 0.5 → 0.4 → 0.1 |
| Prune trigger | Automatic at B→C boundary | Readiness-gated (4 AND-condition checks) |
| Cell mode | Soft throughout | STE in B1/B2/C |
| Teacher distillation | None | `lambda_kd=1.0` in B1/B2 |
| B1 regularizers | (merged with B) | sparsity=5e-5, power=1e-4 |
| B2 regularizers | (merged with B) | sparsity=5e-5 + edge_gate=1e-5 + power=1e-5 |

### 2.15 Persistent bounded drive (persistent-drive plan)

Each stage can receive a bounded drive current pulling driven hidden nodes toward an input-derived target pattern. Controlled via `--persistent-drive` CLI flag (requires `write_mode='fan_out'`). Per-stage `FanOutInputMapper` produces drive targets from input. Drive current is computed as:

```
I_drive = I_sat · tanh(g · (x_drive − x) / I_sat)
```

where `g = softplus(raw_drive_g)` is a learnable per-node conductance. Drive scales decay across stages `[1.0, 0.5, 0.25]` (configurable via `DRIVE["drive_scales"]`). Driven nodes are forced open during pruning (protected from gate-based removal). Driven node gates are forced open (masked to 1.0) in `rhs()`.

### 2.16 Parallel edge repeats

`repeat_edges(topo, n)` duplicates every `EDGE_TYPE_HIDDEN` edge n times in `topology.py`. Each repeated edge gets independent logits/gate/multiplier in `DifferentialStage`. Their currents sum naturally in KCL via scatter-add (physically: parallel branches). Controlled via `--edge-repeats N` (default 2, range 1-8 in `train_script.py`). Composes multiplicatively with `--bidirectional`. Non-hidden edges (input, proj, output) are NOT repeated.

### 2.17 Bidirectional edges

All graph primitives (`line_graph`, `ring_graph`, `grid_graph`, `cluster_graph`) accept `bidirectional=True`, emitting two directed edges per unique undirected pair (i→j and j→i). Edge count is exactly 2× the single-direction count. Gives asymmetric cell types (P/rectifier) true bidirectional capability. Controlled via `--bidirectional` CLI flag. Composes multiplicatively with `--edge-repeats`.

### 2.18 Dynamic topology overrides

`train_script.py` supports runtime topology overrides via CLI flags:
- `--hidden-family {grid,cluster}`: override the hidden-node graph family.
- `--num-hidden N`: number of hidden nodes (required for cluster family).
- `--num-stages N`: number of ODE stages (divides t_span/num_steps equally).
- `--grid-size N`: override per-problem grid default.
- `--bidirectional`: emit dual edges per pair.
- `--edge-repeats N`: parallel edges per hidden pair (1-8).
- `--cell-library {legacy,v15,v2,relu,tanh}`: select cell library.

The `_make_dynamic_preset()` function in `train_script.py` builds a fresh preset dict that overrides the topology of the named problem while preserving problem-specific fields (num_inputs, loss, out_dim, schedule). `_validate_hidden_family_args()` validates combinations before any expensive setup.

### 2.19 Per-dim diagnostics (CTLE pipeline)

`train_ctle.py` computes per-dimension MSE, R², and target variance on every validation epoch. Stats are logged to `per_dim_stats.txt` (TSV) and summarized in a 4-subplot figure `per_dim_stats.png`. The `worst_dim` (parameter with highest MSE) is printed to console each epoch. The combined plot includes retrain data when pruning is enabled. Refactored into `_plot_per_dim_diagnostics()`.

**make_cell_library(library_name, num_edges)** — Factory: returns `SimpleEdgeLibrary` for `relu`/`tanh`, `IdealizedCellLibrary` for `legacy`/`v15`/`v2`.

### `topology.py`
**Graph construction, topology management, and pruning.**

Three-layer API:
1. **Primitives:** `line_graph()`, `ring_graph()`, `grid_graph()`, `cluster_graph()`, `empty_graph()` (all support `bidirectional` param)
2. **Connectors:** `connect_bipartite()`, `connect_projection()`
3. **Composer:** `StageTopologyBuilder`, `MultiStageTopology.from_config()`

Key data structures:
- `SparseTopology` — universal sparse graph with src/dst edge lists, node kinds, edge types
- `validate_topology()` — sanity checks (no self-loops, density limits measured on UNIQUE directed pairs, not raw edge count, to support parallel repeats/bidirectional)
- `validate_topology_degrees(write_idx, read_idx)` — hard-error check that write→read is >1 hop
- `repeat_edges(topo, n)` — duplicate `EDGE_TYPE_HIDDEN` edges n times for parallel branches
- `topology_to_stage()` — filters I/O edges, remaps node IDs, builds DifferentialStage (supports persistent drive via `write_idx` param)
- `prune_stage(stage, ...)` — structural pruning with joint Z+gate criterion, connectivity backstop, protected nodes, edge-only mode, SimpleEdgeLibrary handling, persistent drive transfer; returns `(new_stage, node_remap)`
- `prune_network(core, ...)` — applies `prune_stage` to all stages, protects driven nodes, returns `(new_core, stage_remaps)`
- `build_net_from_preset()` / `build_net_from_config()` — factory functions supporting all write/read modes, persistent drive, all per-stage config options (edge_repeats, bidirectional, etc.)

### `differential_stage.py`
**DifferentialStage** — A single ODE stage with sparse COO graph + Heun integration.

Per-node dynamics:
```
C_eff · dxⱼ/dt = Σ_{e: dst(e)=j} I_e − Σ_{e: src(e)=j} I_e + I_driveⱼ − leakⱼ · xⱼ − clip(xⱼ)
```

- `rhs(x, ctx, tau, cell_mode, x_drive, drive_scale)` — computes dx/dt at current state (applies node gates `σ(u_logits)` as all-ones; applies edge gates `σ(z_logits)` to i_edge; accumulates KCL via float32 scatter-add for AMP robustness; adds persistent drive current when enabled)
- `forward(x0, ctx, t_span, num_steps, tau, store_trajectory, cell_mode, x_drive, drive_scale)` — Heun integration, returns `(x_final, [batch, N, steps+1] trajectory)`
- `drive_current(x, x_drive, drive_scale)` — bounded tanh drive current at driven nodes
- Parameters: `logits [E, Q]` (None when SimpleEdgeLibrary), `raw_mult [E]` (None when SimpleEdgeLibrary), `raw_leak [N]`, `z_logits [E]`, `u_logits [N]`, `raw_drive_g [len(write_idx)]` (when drive enabled)
- Buffers: `src`, `dst` (COO format edge lists)
- Helper methods: `edge_gates()`, `node_gates()` (deprecated, returns all-ones), `active_edge_mask()`, `active_node_mask()` (deprecated), `parameter_breakdown()`
- `compile_rhs(backend)`: wraps `rhs` with `torch.compile`
- `_is_simple` / `is_simple_device`: True when using `SimpleEdgeLibrary`

### `sim_context.py`
**SimContext** — PVT + mismatch container for one forward pass.

- `SimContext(temp_c, global_gain_shift, edge_mismatch)` — dataclass with `.to(device)` method
- `sample_random_context(num_edges, num_cells, ...)` — factory for training variation injection
- temp_c is deprecated (RR-C): defaults to `VARIATION["temp_c_default"]` (27.0°C), no longer randomized

### `stage_transfer.py`
**StageTransfer** — Width-changing layer between stages. No learnable parameters.

- If `out_nodes < in_nodes`: truncates
- If `out_nodes > in_nodes`: zero-pads
- If equal: identity pass-through

### `io_mapper.py`
**Input/Output mappers** — Write and read phases.

- `InputMapper(in_dim, out_dim)` — `x_hidden(0) = x_max · tanh(Linear(u))`, Xavier init scaled by gain_scale. Used in `--write-mode dense`.
- `RobustInputMapper(in_dim, out_dim)` — adds per-feature learnable log-scale preconditioner. Used in `--write-mode dense` when `use_robust_input=True` (housing preset).
- `SparseInputMapper(in_dim, out_dim, write_idx)` — one-to-one writer. Each input feature `u_i` writes to `h_{write_idx[i]}` via independent `(gain_i, bias_i)` pair; non-write positions are zero. Parameter count = `2 * in_dim`. Used in `--write-mode one_to_one` (default). Raises `ValueError` if `in_dim > out_dim`.
- `FanOutInputMapper(in_dim, out_dim, fan_out_map)` — multi-target writer. Each input feature writes to K>1 hidden nodes via per-target (gain, bias) pairs. Hidden nodes NOT in the union of all targets are zero. Parameter count = `2 * K_total`. Used by `smooth2d_grid` and `ctle_grid` presets (`--write-mode fan_out`).
- `OutputMapper(node_dim, out_dim, read_idx=None)` — `ŷ = Linear(x_read)`, no activation. With `read_idx=None` (dense), reads from projection portion. With `read_idx` (sparse, default), gathers from specified full-state indices.

### `kirchhoff_net.py`
**KirchhoffNet** and **KirchhoffNetWithIO** — Top-level network classes.

- `KirchhoffNet(stages, transfers, stage_times, stage_steps)` — multi-stage ODE core
  - Handles per-stage edge_mismatch slicing internally
  - Forward pass supports `cell_mode`, `drive_targets`, `drive_scales`
  - `parameter_breakdown()` for diagnostics
- `KirchhoffNetWithIO(input_mapper, core, output_mapper, hid_count, proj_count, final_hid_count, final_proj_count, write_idx, read_idx, enable_drive, drive_mappers, drive_scales)` — write/evolve/read pipeline
  - `hid_count` / `proj_count` enforce the honest I/O split
  - `final_hid_count` / `final_proj_count` define the final-stage read_slice
  - `enable_drive` / `drive_mappers` / `drive_scales` implement persistent bounded drive per stage
  - When all `core.stage_times` are 0, forward is identity (mapper-only ablation)
  - `forward(u, ctx, tau, store_trajectory, cell_mode)` → `(ŷ, trajectories)`

### `train.py`
**Loss functions, regularizers, tau annealing, training loop, three-phase and four-phase schedules.**

- `compute_loss(net, x0, target, ctx, task_fn, ..., lambdas, tau, return_parts, amp, amp_dtype, reg_scale, cell_mode, teacher, lambda_kd, teacher_tau, teacher_cell_mode)` — total = task + rail + KD + reg_scale·(sparsity + edge_gate + node_gate + power + capacitance) − entropy_bonus. Splits into task+rail+KD (data-dependent) and structural (parameter-only) components for DataParallel safety. Supports AMP autocast, cell_mode='ste', teacher distillation.
- `compute_solver_loss(net, b, x_star, A, ctx, ...)` — solver-specific: residual + 0.1·solution + regularizers (preserved on disk; not active in paper v1)
- `tau_for_epoch(epoch, total_epochs, tau_init, tau_final)` — monotonic exponential decay with smooth linear hardening in the last fraction of training
- `reg_schedule(epoch)` — piecewise linear warm-up: [0, W) off, [W, W+A) linear anneal, [W+A, ∞) full
- `apply_reg_schedule(lambdas, epoch)` — returns copy of lambdas with structural terms scaled by reg_schedule
- `phase_boundaries(total_epochs)` / `phase_for_epoch(...)` / `three_phase_tau(...)` / `three_phase_lambdas(...)` — three-phase schedule infrastructure
- `four_phase_boundaries(...)` / `phase_for_epoch_four(...)` / `four_phase_tau(...)` / `four_phase_lambdas(...)` / `four_phase_kd_active(...)` — four-phase schedule infrastructure
- `prune_readiness_check(...)` — readiness-gated prune trigger (AND-logic: ratio, cell prob, gate stability, improvement)
- `compute_solidification_metrics(net, tau)` — returns dict of mean cell prob, P(Z), gate openness fractions
- `validate_argmax(net, val_loader, ...)` — validation with τ→0.001 (argmax cell selection) for solidification diagnostics
- `make_optimizer(net, lr, weight_decay, stage_lr_scale, mapper_lr_scale)` — AdamW with optional per-stage geometric LR scaling AND optional mapper LR scaling. Creates separate param groups for stage/mapper/other params when scale != 1.0.
- `apply_ablation(net, ablation)` — in-place structural ablation: 'none', 'mapper-only', 'empty-graph'
- `train_epoch(net, loader, optimizer, task_fn, ctx_factory, epoch, ...)` — single-epoch loop with AMP support

2. InputMapper:  u [B, in_dim]  →  x0 [B, N_active₀]  (write phase)
       │
3. Stage 0 Heun (50 steps @ t_span=5):
         │    for step in 1..num_steps:
        │        x_src = x[:, src]; x_dst = x[:, dst]
        │        i_edge = CellLibrary(x_src, x_dst, logits, raw_mult, x_max, ctx, tau,

        │        acc += i_drive                            (persistent drive, optional)

         → backward through steps
```

### Training step — three-phase schedule

```
1. Determine phase for current epoch (A/B/C via phase_boundaries).
2. Compute tau via three_phase_tau (phase-dependent annealing).
3. Compute effective_lambdas via three_phase_lambdas (phase-dependent weights,
   including warmup within Phase B).
4. Forward pass (same as legacy).
5. At B→C boundary: auto-prune (remove low-gate edges, transfer I/O mappers).
6. Phase C: retrain compact network with post-prune lambdas.
```

### Training step — four-phase schedule

```
1. Determine phase for epoch (A/B1/B2/C via phase_for_epoch_four).
2. Clone frozen teacher from best Phase A checkpoint (at A→B1 boundary).
3. Compute tau via four_phase_tau (phase-dependent annealing).
4. Compute effective_lambdas via four_phase_lambdas.
5. Resolve cell_mode: Phase A=soft, B1/B2/C=STE (straight-through estimator).
6. Forward pass with teacher distillation in B1/B2:
     L = L_task + lambda_kd * MSE(y_student, y_teacher) + rail + structural
7. In Phase B2: evaluate readiness check every validate epoch.
8. On readiness trigger (or B2→C boundary fallback):
     auto-prune (edge-only, edge_threshold=0.05, no node-gate pruning).
9. Phase C: retrain compact network with STE cell mode.
```

### Training step — CTLE distillation (four-phase with teacher KD)

```
1. Load pre-trained RegimeAwareMoE teacher from checkpoint (frozen, eval mode).
2. Generate synthetic CTLE spec samples (LHS over 4/8 spec dimensions) and label
   them with teacher forward pass → logits (optionally normalized per-dim).
3. Build KirchhoffNet student via make_ctle_preset().
4. Four-phase training (A: free fit, B1: cell commit + KD, B2: edge prune + KD,
   C: retrain compact) using the same four_phase infrastructure from train.py.
5. At the end: evaluate per-dim MSE/R², physical parameter relative error,
   and save both pre-prune and pruned models.
```

### Input/Output edge filtering

`SparseTopology` includes input/output edges for topology visualization and validation. `topology_to_stage()` **removes** them — only hidden and projection edges enter the ODE core. This means:
- Input nodes are placeholders consumed by InputMapper (write path)
- Output nodes are placeholders consumed by OutputMapper (read path)
- The ODE only evolves hidden + projection nodes

---

## 6. Training Pipeline

### Temperature annealing

τ controls the softness of library selection. High τ = soft mixture (exploration), low τ = hard selection (exploitation).

Schedule: monotonic exponential decay with smooth linear hardening in the last 20% of training:

```
τ_base = max(τ_min, τ_init · exp(−epoch / (total_epochs · 0.5)))
τ = τ_base for first 80% of training
τ = linear interpolate from τ_base → τ_final over last 20%
```

Configuration:
- `TAU.init = 1.0`, `TAU.final = 0.1`, `TAU.min = 0.15`
- `TAU.hardening_epoch_frac = 0.1` (10% on each side = 20% transition window)
- `TAU.final_pretrain = 0.8` (two-phase tau: pre-prune annealing stops at 0.8, retrain continues 0.8→0.1)

### Initialization

Initial logits are all zero, with `logits_z_bias=0.0` applied to the Z index. With 4 cells (L/S/P/Z), this gives equal P=0.25 for each cell at init (fix-z-death: was +1.0 bias giving P(Z)≈0.42, which combined with tau annealing 1.0→0.1 amplified to ~99.99% Z by end of training).

Gate logits are initialized at 0.0 so `σ(0) ≈ 0.50` with `dσ/dz ≈ 0.25`. This places gates at the **maximum-gradient** point of the sigmoid, giving the regularizer maximum sensitivity to push gates open or closed.

- `raw_mult`: zeros → multiplicity = softplus(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69
- `raw_leak`: −3.0 → leak = softplus(−3) ≈ 0.05
- `raw_drive_g`: −1.0 → drive g = softplus(−1) ≈ 0.27
- InputMapper/SparseInputMapper gain: Xavier uniform scaled by `gain_scale=1.0`

### Gradient handling

- Clip gradients to norm 5.0
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay 1e-4 (lr=3e-4 at default batch_size=1024)
- Two scheduler types:
  - `'cosine'` (default): CosineAnnealingLR with `T_max` based on phase boundaries
  - `'warm_restarts'`: CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts (T_0=50, T_mult=1, eta_min=1e-5)
- SimContext is no_grad (variation doesn't get gradients)
- AMP autocast on forward+loss, GradScaler for grad scaling
- torch.compile on cell_lib and rhs (disabled with DataParallel or when setup fails)

### Mapper LR control

When `--mapper-lr-scale < 1.0`, `make_optimizer()` creates a separate AdamW param group for I/O mapper (input_mapper + output_mapper) parameters at `lr * mapper_lr_scale`. Non-stage, non-mapper parameters receive the base LR. Composition with `--stage-lr-scale` is supported: when both are active, three param groups exist (stage-specific, mapper, other). The mapper group gets `lr * mapper_lr_scale` regardless of stage.

`--freeze-mappers` (four_phase only): freezes I/O mapper `requires_grad` during the first half of the combined B1+B2 duration. Mappers train normally in Phase A, freeze at B1 start, unfreeze at the midpoint. After unfreeze, mappers resume at the `--mapper-lr-scale` rate.

### Per-stage LR scaling (stage-lr-scaling)

Multi-stage networks suffer from **vanishing gradients in early stages**: the gradient norm of stage 0 parameters can be 4–5 orders of magnitude smaller than stage 2 because gradient information must flow backward through multiple ODE solves.

To compensate, `make_optimizer()` can create separate param groups per stage with geometrically increasing learning rates for earlier stages:

```
stage i LR = base_lr × scale^(S − 1 − i)
```

Where `S` = number of stages. Example with 3 stages and `scale=10`:
- stage 0 (earliest, smallest gradient) → `lr × 100`
- stage 1 → `lr × 10`
- stage 2 → `lr × 1`

Non-stage parameters (I/O mappers, StageTransfers) receive the base LR by default. Controlled via `--stage-lr-scale` CLI flag (default `1.0`, which collapses to a single standard param group).

**Retrain uses a separate flag `--retrain-stage-lr-scale` (default `1.0`) to avoid over-aggressive updates during warm-start fine-tuning.**

### Persistent bounded drive

When `--persistent-drive` is passed (requires `write_mode='fan_out'`), each stage receives a `FanOutInputMapper` that produces drive targets from the input. The drive current is a tanh-bounded source:

```
I_drive = I_sat · tanh(g · (x_drive − x) / I_sat)
```

where `I_sat = DRIVE["drive_isat"]` (default 0.5 μA) and `g = softplus(raw_drive_g)` (learnable per-node conductance, init `DRIVE["raw_drive_g_init"] = -1.0`). Drive scales decay across stages `[1.0, 0.5, 0.25]` (configurable via `DRIVE["drive_scales"]`).

Driven nodes are forced to survive pruning. In each stage's `rhs()`, the drive current is added to the KCL accumulation before the leak and clip terms.

#### Stage topology: configurable N×N grid

The hidden nodes are arranged as a square grid of size `N × N` in row-major order (default N=7, configurable via `--grid-size N`). Each node connects to its 8 immediate neighbors (Chebyshev distance ≤ 1). Edge count formulas: `2N(N-1)` unique hidden-to-hidden pairs → `2N(N-1)` directed edges. For N=7: 84 hidden edges.

3 projection nodes are appended after the N² hidden nodes, each connected to ALL N² hidden nodes bidirectionally, yielding N² × 3 projection edges. Total state vector per stage is N² + 3 nodes.

#### Multi-stage design

N_stages independent stages (default 3), each with the same topology but **untied weights**. Total t_span=5 and num_steps=50 are split equally.

#### Fan-out write mapping

Each 2D input (x, y) writes to hidden nodes along the left and right columns of the grid. For grid_size ≥ 5: every other row (rows 0,2,4,...). For grid_size < 5: consecutive rows (0..height-2).

| Write/Read | Write: fan-out (4 inputs → 4 grid quadrants, 2 rows each) or dense (cluster). Read: center column (N nodes) + 7 proj nodes. |
| Schedule | `schedule=four_phase` (always; this script is KD-only) |
| Special | Teacher distillation from RegimeAwareMoE (`lambda_kd=1.0` in B1/B2). Per-dim diagnostics. Physical-domain evaluation at end (relative error per converted CTLE parameter). Supports `--persistent-drive`, `--bidirectional`, `--edge-repeats`. Standalone script: `python train_ctle.py --teacher-path /path/to/dagger_student_moe.pt`. |

### Removed presets (R4.2, R4.3)
- `xor` — removed from active PRESETS (weak analog motivation).
- `solver` — sparse linear system benchmark removed from active PRESETS (scope creep for paper v1). The supporting modules (`sparse_solver_data.py`, `sparse_solver_topology.py`, `sparse_solver_baseline.py`, `sparse_solver_track.py`) are preserved on disk for future work.

## 9. Sparse Solver Subsystem (preserved, not in active PRESETS)

The sparse solver benchmark is preserved on disk but **not active in paper v1** (R4.3). Modules:

### `sparse_solver_data.py`
Generates random sparse symmetric positive-definite matrices with controlled condition number via:
1. Random sparse symmetric pattern (scipy.sparse.rand)
2. Diagonal dominance margin (guarantees SPD)
3. Low-rank perturbation to spread eigenvalues to target condition number
4. Bounded random solution `x* = x_max · tanh(randn)`, then `b = A @ x*`

### `sparse_solver_topology.py`
Accumulates matrix sparsity patterns across the training dataset into a fixed union supergraph. Edges appearing in ≥10% of samples become hidden graph edges. Uses `StageTopologyBuilder` to add input/projection edges.

### `sparse_solver_baseline.py`
Digital solvers for comparison against the analog network:
- **Jacobi:** `x_{k+1} = D⁻¹(b − R·x_k)`
- **Conjugate Gradient:** Batched CG with early stopping on convergence
- `compare_against_baselines(net, val_loader, n)` — runs all three methods on the same validation set and prints per-method statistics

### `sparse_solver_track.py`
Convergence diagnostic: captures ODE state snapshots during integration and plots 3-panel figure (residual vs time, solution error vs time, final state magnitude distribution).

## 12. Experimental Results

### 12.1 smooth2d_grid four-phase (5x5, 3-stage) — SUCCESS

**Command:**
```
./venv/bin/python kirchhoff_redesign/ideal/train_script.py \
  --problem smooth2d_grid --grid-size 5 --output result_grid_4_phase_5x5 \
  --schedule four_phase --epochs 800 --lr 3e-4 --batch-size 1024 \
  --stage-lr-scale 1.3 --validate-every 20 --grad-log
```

**Config summary:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Grid size | 5×5 (25 hidden + 3 proj) |
| Stages | 3 |
| Params | ~2000 |
| Teacher | none (direct regression) |
| C_eff | 1.0 |
| Write mode | fan_out |
| Batch size | 1024 |
| LR | 3e-4 |
| Stage LR scale | 1.3 |
| Schedule | four_phase |
| Epochs | 800 |
| Platform | RTX 4090 (kaggle) |

**Outcome:** SUCCESS — val_argmax converged below task loss threshold and readiness-gated prune fired successfully.

**Key metrics:**
| Phase | Epochs | Task loss (train/val) | val_argmax |
|-------|--------|---------------------|------------|
| A | 0–199 | ~0.02 / ~0.03 | ~0.04 |
| B1 | 200–359 | ~0.01 / ~0.02 | ~0.03 |
| B2 | 360–559 | ~0.01 / ~0.02 | ~0.02 |
| C (pruned) | 560–799 | ~0.01 / ~0.02 | ~0.02 |

**Diagnosis:** C_eff=1.0 provided normal solver dynamics. Stage LR scaling (1.3) kept early-stage gradients alive. Fan-out write and center-column + proj readout created clean gradient paths. Readiness gate fired at ~epoch 540 (within B2 window), confirming that cell commitment, gate stability, and convergence all aligned. No Z-hoarding observed — mean_pZ stayed below 0.35 throughout.

### 12.2 CTLE distillation four-phase (4x4, 3-stage, dense write) — FAILED

**Command:**
```
python train_ctle.py --teacher-path /path/to/dagger_student_moe.pt \
  --grid-size 4 --epochs 1000 --lr 12e-4 --batch-size 4096 \
  --write-mode dense --mapper-lr-scale 0.1 --validate-every 20 \
  --stage-lr-scale 1.3
```

Also note that for this experiment t_span was set to 5.0 and num_steps was set to 50.

**Config summary:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Grid size | 4×4 (16 hidden + 7 proj) |
| Stages | 3 |
| Params | 5984 |
| Teacher | MoE 56403 params (~9.4× compression) |
| C_eff | 0.5 |
| Write mode | dense |
| Batch size | 4096 |
| LR | 12e-4 |
| Stage LR scale | 1.3 |
| Mapper LR scale | 0.1 |
| Schedule | four_phase |
| Epochs | 1000 |
| Platform | Kaggle T4x2 |

**Outcome:** FAILED — val plateaued at ~0.70 (never below threshold), readiness-gated prune never fired.

**Key metrics:**
| Phase | Epochs | Best val | Best val_argmax | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------|-------|
| A | 0–249 | ~0.70 | 3.7 (spike) | Z-hoarding: mean_pZ 0.25 → 0.57 |
| B1 | 250–449 | ~0.70 | ~0.71 | val_argmax recovered slightly with KD |
| B2 | 450–699 | ~0.70 | ~0.71 | Readiness never triggered |
| C (fallback) | 700–999 | ~0.70 | ~0.71 | Retrain from fallback prune, no improvement |

**Diagnosis:**
- C_eff=0.5 accelerated dynamics, amplifying gradient imbalance between early/late stages (confirmed: 800× imbalance epoch 0, 2–6× steady state)
- Batch_size=4096 with lr=12e-4 (Goyal scaling: base 3e-4 × 4096/1024 = 12e-4) was too aggressive — caused val_argmax spike in Phase A
- Dense write path (all-to-all) created 16×16=256 input→hidden connections, drowning out the ODE gradients with mapper gradients
- Z-hoarding: mean_pZ reached 0.69 by B1 end, starving L/S/P edges of probability mass
- Platform: Kaggle T4x2 ~4h wall time insufficient for thorough tuning

**Artifacts:** `result_4_phase_4x4_dense_write_moe_distillation_failed/` contains loss_history, config_snapshot, gradient_norms.txt, solidification_metrics.txt, output_log.txt.

### 12.3 Kaggle run notes
- Always verify `--lr` vs Goyal scaling: `lr = base_lr × (batch_size / 1024)`. At batch_size=4096, `lr = 3e-4 × 4 = 12e-4`. Lower to 6e-4 (batch_size=2048) for next attempt.
- C_eff below 1.0 should be avoided unless there is strong evidence the standard dynamics are too slow — the smooth2d SUCCESS used C_eff=1.0.
- Stage LR scaling at 1.3 is effective but may need increase to 1.5 if gradient logs show >10× imbalance in steady state.
- For CTLE distillation, try `--write-mode one_to_one` or fan-out (the ctle_grid default) instead of dense to reduce mapper gradient dominance.
